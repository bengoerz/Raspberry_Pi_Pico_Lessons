# Single Traffic Light

## Overview
This circuit uses a Raspberry Pi Pico to control a simple traffic light.
For simplicity, it is recommended to use a [pre-made traffic light module](https://www.amazon.com/Adeept-Traffic-Creative-Raspberry-RGB-Traffic/dp/B097GK4S2D/). If you elect to wire your own using LEDs, be sure to use an appropriate resistor to avoid damaging the LEDs.
